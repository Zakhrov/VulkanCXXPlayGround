Vulkan Explicit Multi-GPU Playground app
=========================================

This repository is an experimental project to learn about Vulkan and explicit Multi-GPU programming.
I'm following BlurryPiano's [Little Vulkan Engine](https://github.com/blurrypiano/littleVulkanEngine) series of tutorials for Vulkan and implementing Multi-GPU AFR as I go.

This is still VERY early in the stage of development. Multi-GPU AFR right now has been tested with only a pair of Radeon GPUs. A Radeon R7 250X and a Radeon R7 260X both with 2GB of VRAM and no crossfire bridge connected.
